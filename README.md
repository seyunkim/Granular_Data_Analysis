# Granular_Data_Analysis
Analyzing some datasets from Granular

Hi, thanks for taking a look at my jupyter notebook. 

To run,clone this repository and start a virtual enviornment using virtualenv on the root directory. 

You can install all the dependencies I use in the requirements.txt file through the command: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

With that you can start up jupyter notebook and the script written for the analyzed datasets are located in: 
'Granular Farm Data Technical Challenge.ipynb'

Thanks for looking!
